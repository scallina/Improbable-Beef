# Bacteria Analysis - Bellybutton washing study

## To view the Dashboard in action: 

[PATIENT DASHBOARD](https://scallina.github.io/Patient_Bacteria_Analysis/)

### In this project, I used HTML and Javascript to create an interactive dashboard demonstrating specific data for each volunteer in a study. After selecting a patient number, the dashboard will indicate 1) bacteria types, 2) amount of bacteria observed, 3) patient data, and 4) washing frequency for the patient. 

#### The data was extracted from a JSON file containing each parameter of the study.
